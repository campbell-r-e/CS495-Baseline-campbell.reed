#Chatgpt usage 
I used chatgpt to fix the yaml github actions file to use my tests for my python function as well as debugging the tests i wrote.
#Verification 
The github actions yaml file generated by chatgpt is correct beacuse all three test passed and were reconized. 
# What i did myself 
I wrote the python functions as well as wrote my tests off of an example i found online for a summing function. I also based on the LLM recomendation split the tests into 
three functions in order for the test cases to be three test and not all one test.
